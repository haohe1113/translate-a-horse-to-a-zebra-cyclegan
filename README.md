### Summary
In this project, we will build and train a cycleGAN(Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks) model to turn horses into zebras. We will first take a look at the structure of a cycleGAN as well as the four loss functions implemented to train it. We will also have a glimpse at the microarchitecture of each discriminator and generator deployed in a cycleGAN. Lastly, we will talk about how to train a cycleGAN with some very impressive translation outcomes attached at the very end.
